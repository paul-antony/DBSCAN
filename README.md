# DBSCAN Clustering

Implementation of DBSCAN clustering on a dataset without using numpy.

Authors: Job Jacob, Paul Antony

This repo contains seven files: <br />
1) DBSCAN_data.csv --> The csv file containing the dataset used for clustering. <br />
2) main.py --> The main python file that is used for execution. It acts as a controller for the entire task and calls the required functions of the other two python files. <br />
3) dbscan.py --> The python file containing the functions to perform DBSCAN clustering. <br />
4) graphplot.py --> The python file containing the function to plot the different clusters and the noise vectors. <br />
5) DBSCAN_ppt.pdf --> A presentation file explaining the DBSCAN algorithm. <br />
6) dbscan-images --> Folder containing screenshots of our output for the dataset in the DBSCAN_data.csv file. <br />
7) README.md --> Contains data about the repo and the files contained in it.

Steps to run the files in this repo: <br />
1) Download and install a Python 3.X version (https://www.python.org/downloads/). <br />
2) Download and install the latest version of Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/downloads.html). <br />
3) Download the files inside this repo. <br />
4) Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the files in this repo and execute the main.py file. <br />
5) Enjoy the output! <br />
6) Feel free to edit the files and code as per your preference.

GOOD LUCK!!
